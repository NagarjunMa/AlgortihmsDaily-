# Algorithms Daily

A collection of algorithm and LeetCode problems I solve daily, with descriptions and solutions.

## Purpose

This repository tracks my progress in solving algorithm challenges and coding problems. By consistently solving and documenting one problem each day, I aim to:

- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Build a reference library for future review
- Maintain a coding streak

## Structure

Each problem is organized in the following format:

```
/YYYY-MM-DD/
  - README.md (problem description and approach)
  - solution.{extension} (implementation)
  - test.{extension} (test cases if applicable)
```

## Problem Categories

Problems are tagged with one or more of the following categories:

- Array
- String
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Backtracking
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Binary Search
- Hash Table
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Math
- Bit Manipulation
